This personal blog serves as a conduit to mental and emotional health for its writer. Are these facts or fiction? Embrace the trip, question all of it, assemble whatever is relevant to you, and discard the rest.

_I write my thoughts and ideas as a form of therapy. The positive and neutral views and opinions are published, and the negative ones are buried in a wasteland of negative written emotions and reactions. I get it out, so I don't have to carry these. I share these so that somebody else doesn't tumble as I did._
