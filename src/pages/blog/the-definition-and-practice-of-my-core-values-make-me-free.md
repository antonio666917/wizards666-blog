Only after defining my core values was I able to understand my morality and how truthful I was with myself.

This truthfulness is what I call mental and emotional health.

The better I practice and exercise my core values, the healthier I feel mentally and emotionally because I am truthful about what I value and how I want to live. The practice of my values makes me feel free, bringing me into situations where I consistently feel joy because I'm doing as I please. I'm doing what I want, ultimately!

Therefore, practicing integrity brings me joy.
