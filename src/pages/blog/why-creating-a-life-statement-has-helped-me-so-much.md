_Found this interesting note in my archives:_

When our daughter, now 1-year-old, was born, I endured rough patches due to some forced self-reflection. I've thought most of my adult life that I'm a family-centric and "family first" person. Still, through the new responsibilities of having a baby, I noticed that where I put the most effort and hours were work and my leisure activities (playing guitar, reading, exercising, playing video games, playing chess, and playing basketball IRL).

Having a baby accentuated this FACT because of the limitation of hours this introduced in my life. Before our baby girl, I had time to waste; now, I had to choose. And those decisions, as hard as they were, are what fucked me up. So am I focusing my relationship with my wife now, via whatever it may be, or will I knock off some chapters of some random whatever? These decisions validate or invalidate my original idea of "I'm a family man ."If I have 3 "free hours" and I don't spend a single one with my wife and teenage son by the end of the day, am I a family man as I think I am? Baby girl made this evident, and thus came my self-esteem issues.

But not all was lost. I'm a good man, I thought to myself. I have to put in the hours. But who am I? If this one thing is not as I thought it was, what other things are not as I think they are? Self-reflection ensued.

I couldn't figure it out, and I spiraled and struggled. At work, I had a very demanding boss who verbally belittled everybody adjacent to the product we were creating. This behavior deepened my self-doubt, this "holy fuck; I don't know if I'm even good at this," and so forth and deeper down the rabbit hole.

### Ultimately, what helped me?

I created a "Mission Statement" for my life, a document where I explained to an audience who I am. This document outlines your life morals, values, paradigms, and ideals.

### How the hell did that help you?

While creating this document, I could self-reflect on my actions and, whenever appropriate, identify values and paradigms that I wanted but wasn't implementing via action. And this created further action. For example, if I want to be a family man, which tactics do I have to commit to, how many hours, and what activities? The same goes for a statement such as "I am love for those around me. Especially my wife". How are my actions supporting this statement?

This document is not meant to be shared. Instead, it's a document for self-reflection and accountability for yourself. For clarification. For goal setting. So that I can stop lying or manipulating myself and become active; action is, thoughts aren't.
